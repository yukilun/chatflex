## Overview
Chatflex is an instant messaging web application that allows users to communicate through text and images. The purpose of this app was to test Firebase functionality. Firebase is a backend app development platform, which includes various services, such as storage, databases, and authentication. I can focus mainly on front-end development and store user information, chat records, and status in Firebase. With Firebase authentication, Chatflex's users can also log in with their existing Google, Facebook, or GitHub accounts.
